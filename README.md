Refactoring Assignment

The purpose of this assignment was to restructure an existing codebase for a mock marketing website. 
The goal was to optimize the webpage for search engines by improving the codebase so that it would meet accessibility standards.
I acheived this goal by first replacing the existing elements with the correct semantic HTML elements.
I ensured that the elements followed a logical structure independent of position and styling.
Next, I added accessible alt attributes to every icon and image element.
I then edited the heading attributes so that they were organized in sequential order.
Finally, I created a more concise, descriptive title.
After making these changes, the website is now par with accessibilty standards and is optimized for search engines.
